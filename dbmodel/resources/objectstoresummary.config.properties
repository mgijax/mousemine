# (Copied from the online docs)
# See http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/database/database-building/post-processing/objectstore-summary-properties/
# There are several processes run after the data loading is completed, one of which the 
# objectstore summarisation. This step counts the number of objects of particular classes, 
# identifies any empty references/collections and collects values to be appear in dropdowns 
# in the query builder and templates. The summarisation process also constructs the indexes 
# needed for “type-ahead” autocompletion, this is configured by adding entries to the 
# objectstoresummary.config.properties.

# Dropdowns. 
# If number of distinct values in a field <= than the max, users gets a dropdown in the webapp forms.
max.field.values = 250
# SequenceFeature.specificity has a few values that are extremely long, making the dropdown ridiculously wide
# Have to avoid ThreePrimeUTR and friends for now. Postgres generates a bad query plan and the count takes forever (as in, forever).
